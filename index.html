      <h2>His childhood and education </h2>
      <p>Elon Musk was born on June 28, 1971 in South Africa. His father 
was an engineer and his mother was a model. When he turned 17
 he decided to move to Canada in order to avoid a military service. 
Soon after his unusual skills spilled out.His parents say he always loved computers. At the 
age of 12, he started programming. He sold a code 
for video game called Blastar, which let him earn 
500 dollars. That is how it started.

 <p> Elon attended the Queen’s University, and after two years of general studies he transferred to the University of California, where he got a Bachelor degree in economics from the Wharton School, he also got a degree in Physics. After that he was admitted to Stanford, but he quitted it to start his own business.<p>

      <h2>The Zip2 and PayPal</h2>
      <p>In 1995 he and his brother set up a company engaged in the network software called Zip2. The company provided maps and business directories to online newspapers. It helped Musk to obtain contract with the New York Times and the Chicago Tribune.
Four years later Zip2 was bought for 302 million dollars by Compaq.

The money from the sale of the Zip2 Elon invested in the new project called X.com (he was  one of the founders). X.com was an online bank, which merged with Confinity Inc., a software company in March 2000. Afterwards the name was changed to commonly known PayPal. In 2002 Musk sold it for 1,5 billion dollars.

      <h2>His inventions</h2>
      <p>Elon quickly started to dreaming of another brand, that’s why in 2002 he founded Space Exploration Technologies (SpaceX). Musk craved to conquer the space. SpaceX was aiming to design cheaper and better rockets then the competitors and it managed. In 2006 the first rocket Falcon 1 was launched, then in 2009 he released Falcon 9 and after three years they beat the competition inventing the Falcon Heavy, that was able to carry almost 53 000 kg to orbit. Currently Elon is developing a vehicle, that can carry up to 100 people. It seems to be totally reusable. The name of the starship sounds Super Heavy. It will be powered by 28 Raptor engines and will be able to lift at least 100 tonnes of payload and 150 tonnes to low Earth orbit.Speaking of Elon Musk we cannot forget about Tesla, which specialise in electric cars. In 2006 the company introduced the Roadster, its first car. What makes it stand out is that it could travel 245 miles on a single charge. In this way Tesla started to be perceived as something special. 
Another feature of this is that it’s cars can go from 0 to 60 miles per hour in less than four seconds. </p>
